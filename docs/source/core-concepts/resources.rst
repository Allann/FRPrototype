Resources
=========

Below you will find many of the resources I have used in constructing the prototype.  Trying to adhere to the principals
of clean code and onion architecture.  My biggest influence has always been Bob Martin's teachings and I strive to 
teach others the same.  If you have a spare weekend, sit down and binge watch the Clean Code lessons below and take in the 
principals he teaches.

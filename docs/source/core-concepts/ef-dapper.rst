Entity Framework Core and Dapper
================================

The describes using Entity Framework Core and Dapper together in the same application. 
Another major point of discussion will be transactions. By the end of this, we will have an application that works with both 
Entity Framework Core and Dapper alongside each other, but also intelligent enough to rollback data whenever there is an exception with the process.

We will also take a look at `ThrowR`_, a simple library for .NET Core that can make your code clean and readable by eliminating the use of *if* statements unnecessarily.

Dapper
------

Dapper is a simple Object Mapping Framework or Micro-ORM that helps us to map the data from the result of an SQL Query to a .NET Class efficiently. 
It would be as simple as executing a SQL Select statement using the SQL Client object and returning the result as a mapped C# class. 
Itâ€™s more like AutoMapper for the SQL world. This powerful ORM was build by the folks at StackOverflow and is definitely faster at querying 
data when compared to the performance of Entity Framework. This is possible because Dapper works directly with the RAW SQL and hence the 
time-delay is quite less. This boosts the performance of Dapper.
